  In the summer of 2020, between the first two COVID case spikes in the US, I was lucky enough be
  able to visit family in Jackson, Wyoming. The wife and I piled our two girls (1 and 3 at the time)
  and made the two-day drive from the Bay Area to Jackson Hole.

Parenting is hard. And nothing hammers that fact home like the experience of suddenly having two additional adults suddenly available to take on a percentage of the child care. Finding myself in one of my favorite places on Earth and without the guilt of burdening my wife with solo-parenting, the time was ripe for adventure.

Over the last few years, I've been working to build my skills and experience in off trail hiking and scrambling. A safe, manageble objective for me was Cody Peak, a ~10,700 foot peak at the southern tip of Grand Teton National Park. An added bonus of the peak is that you can make use of the Jackson Hole ski mountain tram, turning a full day excursion into something doable in an afternoon.

With COVID, the tram was shut down but I was still able ride the gondola up and save 3,000' of elevation gain. From there it was a relatively easy couple miles until the scrambling began.

The most challenging scrambling was right off the trail to reach the top of the right-most peak in the above photo. The scrambling was rather tame, easy class 3. I opted to take a route with a little more climbing for fun but was never concerned about a fall -- I'd bring an adventerous friend with no experience here. The gravely slopes actually felt sketchier as I was always a little woried about my feet coming out from under me.

After gaining the ridge it easy walking over some larger but sturdier loose stones to the summit of Cody Peak.

I did some exploring and ate some snacks at the summit before turning around and heading home. The next challenge is to extend the route and continue south from the peak until the ridgeline meets up with a trail and descends to Fish Creek Road.

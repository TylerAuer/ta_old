<DropCapP>
  In your path from beginner to hobbyist to professional programmer, you'll find that the right tool
  can make a huge difference in your productivity and growth. This is a list of things I found to be
  really helpful as I started my professional journey.

## Code Editor

The most important resource as you are learning is a **good editor**. You can write code in any text-editor but one designed specifically for programming comes with many features that will make your life better, _way_ better.

A code editor does many things you will immediately appreciate. Things like syntax highlighting,[^1] autocompletion,[^2] multiple-cursors, and much more. These can save a lot of time and help you learn.

[^1]: **Syntax Highlighting** - Color coding your code based on the language or format of the file. This makes it easier for you to notice patterns and errors. Also, it looks pretty.
[^2]: **Autocompletion** - Your editor will recognize all different things as you type and offer to autocomplete what you are typing. This is especially useful for avoiding bugs from typos.

Choosing the right editor is very much about what feels right to you. And, there are a lot of options. Popular choices include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

But, if you are just getting into coding, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (usually just referred to as "VS Code"). It's an editor that's incredibly powerful and [popular](https://www.software.com/src/ranking-the-top-5-code-editors-2019), but also _friendly_ for beginners.

Programmers like to do everything on their keyboard with shortcuts because moving their hand to and from their mouse is slow.[^3] So most editors have bare-bones, stripped-down interfaces. VS Code's is more robust. There are good 'ol buttons and menus you can click on as you learn. But, it also has all of keyboard-based shortcuts and tools other editors offer. VS Code also has an extensive extension library with easy, one-click installs. This is awesome when you are beginning.

[^3]: I know this sounds crazy, but you'll get to this point too. I really recommend making a habit of trying to learn a few different shortcuts at a time. When you find yourself doing something without using the shortcut, undo it and then redo it with the shortcut. You'll be amazed at how quickly you start using it without thinking.

Finally, VS Code has excellent [Git](https://git-scm.com/) integration. If you've never used Git, then you'll appreciate how easy VS Code makes it to use. It provides a graphical interface for Git which is more intuitive than using the command line when you are learning. With that in mind...

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system, a sort of Google Docs for your code. It tracks the changes to your code ("diffs") each time you "commit" your files. It also allows you and others to branch your work off and then merge in those changes once they are done. This way you always have a working "main" branch and can develop new ideas in isolated "feature" branches.

Git it makes it easy to collaborate when paired with [GitHub](https://github.com/) -- a separate service that is an online repository for codebases. Developers work on a project on their machine. Then "push" their changes to GitHub where other developers can review or "pull" their work. Git and GitHub's learning curve can be a little steep at first, but using a visual interface after a few tutorials should get you confortable enough to never need to save archived or versioned copies of files again.

## Monospace Font with Ligatures

I didn't realize how much this mattered to me until I found a font I really liked. And, boy do I love [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#key-features)!

Coding fonts are monospaced, which means that each character is the same width. This is crucial for coding where spacing is visually helpful and sometimes a requirement of the language. But, many monospaced fonts can be unpleasant to look at for eight hours a day.

Fonts designed for coding pay particular attention to symbols like `` ` ``, `|`, and `=>` that aren't as common outside of code. And, they are specifically designed to make it easier to differentiate between easily confused letters and letter combinations. Many fonts accomplish this with ligatures[^4] which can help you read your code more easily.

[^4]: A [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature) is the combining of multiple characters into one symbol. This is common with fi, fl or th in many fonts, but coding fonts often include ligatures for other character sequences like: `=`, `==`, and `===`. There are other coding fonts that offer ligatures like [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), but JetBrains Mono is my favorite.

## Emmet

[Emmet](https://emmet.io/) is a plugin for code editors (it comes preinstalled with VS Code) that helps you generate HTML content quickly. Once you get the hang of it, you'll save tons of time typing out annoying HTML syntax with classes, IDs, and more.

The syntax isn't too tricky to pick up, but it is extremely powerful. For example, here's a more complex command from the docs that generates HTML that would be a pain to type: `#page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li*5>a{Item $}`

```html [] {}
<div id="page">
  <div class="logo"></div>
  <ul id="navigation">
    <li><a href="">Item 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Item 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Item 3</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Item 4</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Item 5</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Window Manager (macOS)

When coding, you'll often be moving back and forth between a few applications at a time. You'll want a terminal, an editor, and browser open all at once. You'll want these arranged nicely on your screen to avoid having to switch back and forth over-and-over.

MacOS has some built in features to help with this, but it's worth picking up a 3rd party option with a little more power especially if you have a larger external monitor. I use [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) but there is also a free option called [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle). Both of these let you snap your windows to different positions instantly with shortcuts.

## Alfred (macOS)

MacOS's Spotlight feature ( <kbd>âŒ˜ + space</kbd> ) is great for quickly opening apps, doing calculations, and many other tasks. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is Spotlight on steroids. It's more powerful and highly customizable. Alfred can hook into your terminal and password manager, search specific sites, and much more. I can't recommend it enough. The paid version also gives you access to your clipboards history, so you can still paste text after copying other things.

## iTerm2, Powerlevel10k, and (maybe) Fish (macOS)

While many beginners are intimidated by the command line (I certainly was) you'll learn to love its power and efficiency. The command-line -- often also called a shell or terminal -- lets you control your computer with text commands. MacOS uses Zsh or Bash which provide very similar commands and languages for scripting commands. If you are feeling adventurous, you can try [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) an alternative to Bash and Zsh that provides a few more modern features. You can easily change your default shell with one command, so it's low risk to try it out.

Customizing your terminal set up is a great way to make it more accessible as you are learning. The first thing to do is to install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) which is similar to Terminal but more powerful. Next, you'll want to customize the theme. This can be confusing to set up. Oh My Zsh is a popular way to do this, but I strongly recommend [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). It's the best looking, the most customizable, and has the best tutorial to make the setup process easier.

## Pock (if your Mac has a Touch Bar)

If you've got a Touch Bar, you probably find it to be useless. [Pock](https://pock.dev/) is a free app that lets you customize your Touch Bar and make it useful.

I built the [Fruit Matrix](https://fruit.tylerauer.com/#/), an app where you can rate sixteen different fruits based on their tastiness and ease of eating then see how your ratings compare to everyone else's. Here's why I built it and what the development process was like.

## Why Did I Build This?

One of my all-time favorite activities as a math teacher is to use a 2D-graph for rating things as a way of building understanding around the Cartesian Plane.

Elementary students see lots of charts (pie charts, bar charts, etc.) but those usually represent one concept, one dimension at a time. Jumping to two-dimensions is not trivial, and students have a hard time with it at first.

Consider this snapshot of the aggregate ratings on the Fruit Matrix:

The location of each single piece of fruit actually represents two pieces of information: the tastiness and easiness. Pineapples are highly rated in taste but have a low rating for easiness.

To understand the graph you need to be able to consider both dimensions separately. Later, you'll also likely want to understand how they interact (correlate).

This activity is fun! But, it doesn't require an app. You can print out sheets of paper then hang them on a bulletin board. In fact, teachers have been doing this for a long time. And, they've been using fruit since Randall Munroe's [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) blog published comic 388.

The folks at [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) were the first to digitize the experience in a way that added value. In their lesson, [Pomegraphit](https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/58cb067910f10b0a21d4db93), they keep track of an entire class's worth of data. By sharing activity codes, you can have them track a whole grade or school's ratings which was quite fun.

But, I wondered, what if you wanted to keep track of everyone's ratings, forever? And, the Fruit Matrix was born.

## Building the Fruit Matrix

My first attempt to build the Fruit Matrix was when I was a teacher. I knew a little Python and a bit of JQuery. I figured I could just google D3 and figure it out from there. Not so much.

Fast-forward a couple years. I've finished my last year of teaching (while studying at nights) and am building a portfolio as I move into software development.

I laid out a set of projects that would build my skills and the Fruit Matrix was a great fit: full-stack with some tricky UI to manage. I knew I would use Express, React, and Postgres since those were the technologies I was trying to get better at using.

I started sketching and planning before I wrote a lick of code. First I laid out what I wanted my app to be able to do. Then I figured out what data would be needed to make that happen and what parts of my application would need access to each piece of data. Some challenges quickly emerged.

## How Can I Know Where the Fruit is Located?

Two of my design requirements were in conflict here. I wanted to make sure the app was responsive to different screen sizes. But I also needed to be able to compare ratings independent of screen size.

[Browsers position items](https://javascript.info/coordinates) on the page relative to the top left corner of the web page.

It's way more complex than that, but the important thing to realize is that when the browser window changes size the value used to refer to an element's position also changes.

The browser uses coordinates to position
